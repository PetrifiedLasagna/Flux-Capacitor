# **Welcome to the Git for Flux Capacitor**

"Flux Capacitor" is a web application designed to give the highest quality toolset to ease the task of transcribing music. The entire application is written in pure JavaScript, so if you have a browser that supports HTML5, then you should be able to run this no problem.

Check out the live demo on my scripting site.

**(Alpha 0.0.4)**

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Aren't there similar applications on the web?**

Why yes fellow reader, there are. However, there are none that are this comprehensive. Even fewer can be said to be based on entirely on JavaScript.

**The file I loaded is not playing!**

Please make sure that you give it some time to load. A one second stereo file takes a couple of seconds to load and decode. After that, you can press the play button and it will play.

In the future, I will have it show a prompt for when the file is done loading.

**How can I download this?**

There is no special setup to this. All you need to do is put all of the files into one folder and open the HTML file with the browser of your choice.

**Can I help develop this?**

Totally! This project is completely open to the public, and that includes updating the software. All you have to do is fork this repository, and make whatever updates you see fit. After that you can send a pull request and I will get to it as soon as possible.

I do have one limitation and that is that your code must be well tested. I will not pull any code that provides a good explanation of what was added (summary), or that is buggy. :/

**How did you come up with the name?**

I actually took the name from "*Back to the Future*." The device that enables them to travel through time was called the Flux Capacitor, and I decided this would be the perfect fit for the application, since all transcription programs allow you to change the speed of playback time.
